# FSAutomator

FSAutomator is a tool which allows you to automate part of your flight in MSFS (tested only under MSFS2020 on January 2023). The application supports several actions and some "complex" actions (this means that the action gets some data for you, calculates/does something with it, and returns it to the main screen so it's available and usable by the user. Code from DLLs is also supported.
